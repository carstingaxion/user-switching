## Inclusivity and Code of Conduct

Contributions to User Switching are welcome from anyone. Whether you are new to Open Source or a seasoned veteran, all constructive contribution is welcome and I'll endeavour to support you when I can.

This project is released with <a href="https://github.com/johnbillion/user-switching/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">a contributor code of conduct</a> and by participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. The code of conduct is nothing to worry about, if you are a respectful human being then all will be good.

## Setting up Locally

You can clone this repo and activate it like a normal WordPress plugin. If you want to contribute to User Switching, you should install the developer dependencies in order to run the tests.

### Prerequisites

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* A local installation of MariaDB or MySQL

### Setup

1. Install the PHP dependencies:

       composer install

2. Check the MySQL database credentials in the `tests/.env` file and amend them as necessary.

**Important:** Ensure you use a separate test database (eg. `wordpress_test`) because, just like the WordPress test suite, the database will be wiped clean with every test run.

## Running the Tests

To run the whole test suite:

	composer test

To run just the integration tests:

	composer test:integration

To run just the coding standards checks:

	composer test:phpcs

To run just the static analysis:

	composer test:phpstan

To run just the acceptance tests:

	composer test:acceptance

## Releasing a New Version

User Switching gets automatically deployed to the WordPress.org Plugin Directory whenever a new release is published on GitHub.

Assets such as screenshots and banners are stored in the `.wordpress-org` directory. These get deployed as part of the automated release process too.

In order to deploy only changes to assets, push the change to the `deploy` branch and they will be deployed if they're the only changes in the branch since the last release. This allows for the "Tested up to" value to be bumped as well as assets to be updated in between releases.

## Ethical Open Source

User Switching is considered **Ethical Open Source** because it meets all of the criteria of [The Ethical Source Definition (ESD)](https://ethicalsource.dev/definition/):

1. It benefits the commons.
2. It is created in the open.
3. Its community is welcoming and just.
4. It puts accessibility first.
5. It prioritizes user safety.
6. It protects user privacy.
7. It encourages fair compensation.
